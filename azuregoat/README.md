## üéØ Overview

AzureGoat is a **deliberately vulnerable Azure cloud infrastructure** designed for cybersecurity professionals to practice penetration testing, red team operations, and defensive security techniques in a realistic but controlled cloud environment. This comprehensive training platform provides hands-on experience with real-world Azure vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and attack scenarios that mirror actual enterprise cloud deployments.

Built using **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**, AzureGoat deploys a complete vulnerable ecosystem featuring web applications, databases, storage accounts, virtual machines, and identity services - all intentionally configured with security flaws following the latest **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** and common cloud misconfigurations.

## üèóÔ∏è **Vulnerable Azure Infrastructure Components**

### **‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Services Architecture**

#### **üîµ Compute & Application Services**
- **Azure App Functions**: Serverless functions with SSRF vulnerabilities and privilege escalation vectors
- **Web Applications**: React-based vulnerable applications with XSS, SQL injection, and IDOR vulnerabilities
- **Virtual Machines**: Misconfigured VMs with exposed credentials and weak security controls
- **Container Services**: Vulnerable containerized applications with insecure configurations

#### **üî∑ Data & Storage Services**
- **Azure CosmosDB**: NoSQL databases with injection vulnerabilities and exposed sensitive data
- **Storage Accounts**: Misconfigured blob storage with public access and credential exposure
- **Key Vault**: Identity and secret management with privilege escalation opportunities
- **Backup Services**: Vulnerable backup configurations and data exposure scenarios

#### **üîπ Identity & Access Management**
- **Azure Active Directory**: Misconfigured identity services with privilege escalation paths
- **Service Principals**: Overprivileged service accounts and authentication bypass scenarios
- **RBAC Misconfigurations**: Excessive permissions and lateral movement opportunities
- **Managed Identities**: Vulnerable managed identity implementations and token abuse

#### **üî∏ Network & Security Services**
- **Virtual Networks**: Insecure network segmentation and exposed internal services
- **Network Security Groups**: Misconfigured firewall rules and open ports
- **Application Gateways**: Vulnerable load balancer configurations and SSL/TLS issues
- **Private Endpoints**: Misconfigured private connectivity with potential bypass scenarios

## üîß **Vulnerability Categories & Training Scenarios**

### **OWASP Top 10 (2021) Implementation**
