## üéØ Overview

DetectionLab is a **comprehensive SOC analytics laboratory environment** designed for hands-on security operations training, threat detection development, and enterprise monitoring simulation. This multi-cloud platform provides security professionals with a realistic Windows domain environment pre-loaded with industry-standard security tooling and best-practice logging configurations.

Originally developed by Chris Long, this lab environment has been optimized to demonstrate **enterprise-grade SOC capabilities** across multiple deployment platforms including AWS, Azure, ESXi, Hyper-V, and local virtualization.
